# Payment Functionality Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Checkout Error - "Failed to process checkout"

**Root Cause:**
The checkout process was failing due to:
1. Insufficient error handling and logging
2. Potential race conditions in order creation
3. No cleanup mechanism if invoice creation failed after orders were created

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced error handling with detailed console logging throughout the checkout process
- Added automatic cleanup of created orders if invoice creation fails
- Improved error messages to show specific failure points
- Added validation for all required data before processing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Checkout.tsx`
- `src/services/invoiceService.ts`

### Issue 2: Empty Cart on 2Checkout Payment Page

**Root Cause:**
The 2Checkout payment link was using semicolon-separated format for multiple products (e.g., `prod=item1;item2`), but this approach doesn't work correctly with 2Checkout's ConvertPlus API. The correct format requires indexed parameters for multiple products.

**Fix Applied:**
Changed from semicolon-separated format:
```
prod=Design1;Design2
price=30.00;45.00
qty=1;1
```

To indexed parameter format:
```
prod=Design1
price=30.00
qty=1
prod_1=Design2
price_1=45.00
qty_1=1
```

This ensures 2Checkout properly recognizes and displays all cart items.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/twoCheckoutService.ts`

### Issue 3: Payment Link Return URLs

**Root Cause:**
The return URLs were using `window.location.origin` which resolves to the WebContainer URL in development. While this is correct for the current implementation, ensure your production deployment uses the correct domain.

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
const baseUrl = window.location.origin;
const returnUrl = `${baseUrl}/payment/success`;
const cancelUrl = `${baseUrl}/payment/failure`;
```

**Note:** This automatically uses the correct domain in production, but verify your deployment URL is correct.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Invoice Service (`src/services/invoiceService.ts`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive logging at each step
- Implemented transaction-like cleanup: if payment link generation fails, the invoice is deleted
- Better error propagation with descriptive messages
- Validates products array before proceeding

**New Flow:**
```
1. Create invoice in database
2. Generate 2Checkout payment link
3. Update invoice with payment link
4. Link orders to invoice (update invoice_id and payment_status)
5. If any step fails after invoice creation → delete invoice and throw error
```

### 2. Fixed 2Checkout Service (`src/services/twoCheckoutService.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- Changed product parameter format from semicolon-separated to indexed
- First product uses `prod`, `price`, `qty`, `type`
- Additional products use `prod_1`, `price_1`, `qty_1`, `type_1`, etc.
- This matches 2Checkout ConvertPlus API requirements
- Signature calculation updated to include all indexed parameters

### 3. Improved Checkout Page (`src/pages/Checkout.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Implemented automatic cleanup of orders if checkout fails
- Better error messages showing specific failure points
- Added delay before redirect to ensure user sees success message
- Validates all data before processing

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Single Item Checkout
1. Add one stock design to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Click "Place Orders"
4. Verify:
   - Order is created with status "new" and payment_status "unpaid"
   - Invoice is created with status "unpaid"
   - Order is linked to invoice (invoice_id set)
   - Order payment_status updated to "pending_payment"
   - Redirected to 2Checkout page showing 1 item in cart

### Test Case 2: Multiple Items Checkout
1. Add 3 stock designs to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Click "Place Orders"
4. Verify:
   - 3 separate orders are created
   - 1 invoice is created linking all 3 orders
   - All orders show payment_status "pending_payment"
   - Redirected to 2Checkout page showing 3 items in cart with correct prices

### Test Case 3: Admin Invoice Generation
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Invoice Management
3. Select a customer with unpaid orders
4. Generate invoice
5. Verify:
   - Invoice created with all selected orders
   - Payment link generated and displayed
   - All selected orders updated to payment_status "pending_payment"
   - Payment link shows all order items in 2Checkout cart

### Test Case 4: Payment Success Flow
1. Complete a test payment on 2Checkout
2. Verify:
   - Webhook receives payment notification
   - Invoice status updated to "paid"
   - All linked orders payment_status updated to "paid"
   - For stock designs: files copied to order-attachments
   - Customer redirected to success page
   - Success page shows all order numbers

### Test Case 5: Error Handling
1. Attempt checkout with invalid data
2. Verify:
   - Appropriate error message displayed
   - Created orders are cleaned up
   - User can retry checkout

## Console Logging

The fixes include extensive console logging for debugging:

**Checkout Process:**
```
=== CHECKOUT PROCESS STARTED ===
Cart items: X
Customer: email@example.com
Creating orders...
Creating order for: Design Name, Price: 30.00
Order created: ORD-12345 (uuid)
All X orders created successfully
Creating invoice with products: [...]
Calling createInvoiceWithPayment...
=== createInvoiceWithPayment START ===
...
=== CHECKOUT PROCESS COMPLETED ===
```

**On Error:**
```
=== CHECKOUT ERROR ===
Error details: [error object]
Error message: [specific message]
Cleaning up created orders: [order IDs]
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_2CO_MERCHANT_CODE=254923900946
VITE_2CO_BUY_LINK_SECRET=your_secret_key
VITE_2CO_INS_SECRET_WORD=your_ins_secret
VITE_2CO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## Database Trigger Behavior

The database has triggers that automatically:
1. When invoice status → "paid": All linked orders → payment_status "paid"
2. When invoice status → "cancelled": All linked orders → payment_status "unpaid", invoice_id NULL
3. When order invoice_id set: payment_status → "pending_payment" (unless invoice already paid)

## Important Notes

1. **Product Names**: Ensure all stock designs have proper titles (not empty)
2. **Prices**: All prices are formatted to 2 decimal places
3. **Signature**: Using HMAC-SHA256 for payment link signatures
4. **Webhook**: Must be configured in 2Checkout dashboard to point to your webhook endpoint
5. **Return URLs**: Automatically use the correct domain based on `window.location.origin`

## Next Steps

1. Test checkout with 1 item
2. Test checkout with multiple items
3. Verify 2Checkout cart shows all items correctly
4. Complete a test payment and verify webhook updates
5. Check browser console for detailed logs if issues occur
6. Verify stock design files are copied after payment

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the previous code can be restored. The main changes are in:
- `src/services/twoCheckoutService.ts` (line 47-125)
- `src/services/invoiceService.ts` (line 22-102)
- `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` (line 66-183)
