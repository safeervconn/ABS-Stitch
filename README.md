# ABS STITCH - Admin Panel

## Overview
ABS STITCH is a comprehensive embroidery business management system with a powerful admin panel for managing users, orders, and products.

## Recent Fixes & Enhancements

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Auto-refresh Issue
**Problem**: The admin panel was experiencing constant auto-refresh issues that were:
- Clearing form inputs during user interaction
- Preventing data entry
- Causing poor user experience

**Root Cause**: 
- Uncontrolled useEffect hooks with automatic intervals
- Missing dependency arrays causing infinite re-renders
- State updates triggering unnecessary component re-renders

**Solution**:
- Created `useAdminData` hook with proper state management
- Disabled automatic refresh by default
- Implemented manual refresh controls
- Added proper cleanup for intervals and timeouts
- Used refs to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### ✨ New Features Implemented

#### 1. Visual Notification Badges
- Added badge counts for new orders, users, and products
- Badges automatically clear when admin views the respective tab
- Real-time updates without constant refreshing

#### 2. Enhanced Filtering System

**Orders Section**:
- Order status filter (Pending, Assigned, In Progress, etc.)
- Customer search filter (by name/email)
- Date range filters (from/to dates)
- Amount range filters (min/max)

**Users Section**:
- Role-based filtering (Admin, Customer, Sales Rep, Designer)
- Status filtering (Active/Disabled)
- Sales representative filter
- Registration date range

**Products Section**:
- Category filtering
- Status filtering (Active/Inactive)
- Price range filtering
- Stock quantity range filtering

#### 3. Technical Improvements
- Debounced search inputs (300ms delay)
- Proper loading states during filter operations
- Filter selections maintained when navigating between tabs
- Responsive design for mobile admin access
- Error handling and display
- Performance optimizations
