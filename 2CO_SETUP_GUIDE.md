## ðŸ”§ Remaining Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure 2Checkout Dashboard

1. **Log into 2Checkout Dashboard**: https://secure.2checkout.com/cpanel/

2. **Enable IPN (Instant Payment Notifications)**:
   - Navigate to: Integrations â†’ Webhooks & API â†’ IPN Settings
   - Enable IPN notifications
   - Set IPN URL to:
     ```
     https://iutxllhudjckcaiwabud.supabase.co/functions/v1/handle-2co-webhook
     ```

3. **Configure INS Secret Word**:
   - Go to: Integrations â†’ Webhooks & API â†’ Secret word
   - Set secret word to: `?Ly]vI4gJz7m1tnq6*E[`
   - Save changes

4. **Test the Endpoint**:
   - In 2Checkout dashboard, use the "Test IPN" button
   - You should now receive a success response (not "EMPTY RESPONSE")
   - Check the response shows: `{"message":"Endpoint is active and ready","status":"ready"}`

5. **Enable Notification Types**:

     - ORDER_CREATED
     - PAYMENT_AUTHORIZED
     - COMPLETE
     - REFUND_ISSUED
     - FRAUD_STATUS_CHANGED

   - Enable "Digital goods" option
   - Set default currency to USD

8. **Test Mode**:
   - For initial testing, keep "Test mode" enabled
   - Use test card numbers from 2Checkout documentation
   - Switch to production mode when ready

### Step 2: Run Database Migration

The migration has already been created but needs to be applied:

```sql
-- Migration: 20251024104403_add_2checkout_payment_integration.sql
-- This adds invoice_id, payment statuses, 2CO fields, and triggers
```

To apply:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20251024104403_add_2checkout_payment_integration.sql`
3. Execute the migration
4. Verify tables updated successfully

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Supabase

For Edge Functions to access 2CO credentials:

1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Settings
2. Add these secrets:
   - `VITE_2CO_INS_SECRET_WORD` = `?Ly]vI4gJz7m1tnq6*E[`
   - `VITE_2CO_SECRET_KEY` = `?Ly]vI4gJz7m1tnq6*E[`

### Step 4: Test the Integration

#### Test 1: Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl https://iutxllhudjckcaiwabud.supabase.co/functions/v1/handle-2co-webhook
```
Expected: `{"message":"2Checkout IPN endpoint is active","status":"ready"}`

#### Test 2: Create Stock Design with Attachment
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Stock Designs
3. Add a new stock design
4. Upload a ZIP file attachment
5. Verify file is uploaded to `stock-design-files` bucket

#### Test 3: Stock Design Purchase Flow
1. Login as a customer
2. Add stock design to cart
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Complete payment with 2Checkout test card
5. Verify:
   - Orders created with `unpaid` status
   - Invoice created with payment link
   - Orders updated to `pending_payment`
   - After payment, orders updated to `paid`
   - Files copied to order-attachments
   - Customer can download files

#### Test 4: Custom Order Invoice
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Invoices
3. Generate invoice for a customer
4. Select unpaid orders
5. Verify payment link is generated
6. Copy and test payment link
7. Complete test payment
8. Verify invoice status updates to `paid`

#### Test 5: Payment Link Management
1. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Invoices
2. For unpaid invoices, verify you can:
   - Copy payment link
   - Open payment link in new tab
   - Regenerate payment link
   - Mark as paid manually

### Step 5: Monitor and Debug

#### View Webhook Logs
1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ handle-2co-webhook
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Monitor incoming webhook requests
4. Check for any errors in signature verification

#### View Payment Processing
1. Check `invoices` table for:
   - `tco_reference_number` populated
   - `tco_order_id` populated
   - `tco_payment_method` populated
   - Status changed to `paid`

2. Check `orders` table for:
   - `payment_status` changed to `paid`
   - `invoice_id` populated correctly

3. Check `order_attachments` table for:
   - Files copied after payment
   - Correct file paths

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Testing Checklist

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Returns "EMPTY RESPONSE"
**Fixed!** The webhook now handles GET requests and returns a proper response.

### Signature Verification Fails
- Verify INS secret word matches exactly in both systems

- Ensure no extra whitespace in secret word

### Files Not Copying After Payment
- Check Edge Function logs for errors
- Verify source file exists in `stock-design-files`
- Verify target bucket `order-attachments` has correct permissions
- Check `attachment_url` field in `stock_designs` table

### Payment Link Not Working
- Verify all 2CO credentials are correct
- Check signature generation in browser console
- Test with 2Checkout's test card numbers
- Ensure merchant code is correct: 254923900946

### Orders Not Updating to Paid
- Check webhook is receiving notifications
- Verify invoice ID is passed correctly
- Check database triggers are working
- Review Edge Function logs for errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Deployment Checklist

Before going live:

1. [ ] Switch 2Checkout from test mode to production mode
