## üîß What You Need to Do

### Critical (Must Do Before Testing):

1. **Configure 2Checkout Dashboard** (10 minutes):
   - Enable IPN notifications
   - Set IPN URL: `https://iutxllhudjckcaiwabud.supabase.co/functions/v1/handle-2co-webhook`
   - Configure INS secret word: `?Ly]vI4gJz7m1tnq6*E[`
   - Test the endpoint (should no longer show "EMPTY RESPONSE")

2. **Run Database Migration** (2 minutes):
   - Apply migration in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Verify all new columns exist

3. **Set Supabase Edge Function Secrets** (2 minutes):
   - Add `VITE_2CO_INS_SECRET_WORD` in Supabase Dashboard
   - Add `VITE_2CO_SECRET_KEY` in Supabase Dashboard

### Recommended (For Production):

4. **Test the Full Flow** (30 minutes):
   - Upload stock design with ZIP file
   - Complete test purchase
   - Verify webhook processing
   - Check file copy to order-attachments
   - Confirm customer can download files

5. **Monitor Webhook Logs** (ongoing):
   - Check Edge Function logs for any errors
   - Verify signature verification works
   - Monitor payment processing

## üìä Architecture Overview

```
Customer Checkout Flow:

3. Invoice created with all orders
4. 2CO payment link generated automatically
5. Orders updated to pending_payment
6. Customer redirected to 2Checkout
7. Customer completes payment
8. 2CO webhook notifies your system
9. Webhook verifies signature
10. Invoice updated to paid
11. Database trigger updates all orders to paid
12. Files auto-copied from stock-design-files to order-attachments
13. Customer redirected to success page
14. Customer can download files from dashboard

Admin Invoice Flow:
1. Admin selects unpaid orders
2. Creates invoice for customer
3. Payment link generated automatically
4. Admin copies link and sends to customer
